# 6. ðŸ“š Home Task

The home task should be done using TypeScript.

:::info
The starter code for the home task is located in _docs/4-functional-programming/hometask_ folder.
:::

## Testing the project

In the project directory, run the command bellow to install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

To try to run the _example.ts_, enter the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

To run the tests, enter the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Task

Imagine that there is some executor, or taxi driver, whatever, who needs to reach some clients. Each client has some `position` and the `reward` for reaching the executor. Also, client might have a list of `demands`. If they are exist, it means that the executor should have such `possibilities` to meet them.

The main task is to write a code inside the `show` function in `/src/main.ts`. This function takes two parameters and should return the string in the format below:

```
This executor meets the demands of only 3 out of 4 clients

Available clients sorted by highest reward:
name: Philip, distance: 30.364, reward: 600
name: John, distance: 21.378, reward: 250
name: Gregor, distance: 20.025, reward: 230
```

But before starting, you need to implement the missed parts of some utils and algebraic types.

## Requirements

During the implementation of each of the functions in utils, you should verify its correctness in the tests. It is also a good example of how the function would be used.

Steps:

1. First of all, you need to finish the implementation of the `pipe` and `flow` functions (`src/fp/utils.ts`). The `flow` currently accepts only a maximum of up to 3 functions. You need to extend it up to 4 by adding new overloads. Same with the `pipe` - extend it up to 4 and provide the implementation.
2. Next, you can move to `src/fp/maybe.ts`. Get to know what it is, look at the examples in the tests, and implement the code of the `fold` and `fromNullable` functions.
3. Move to `src/fp/either.ts` and implement code of the `map`, `fold` and `fromPromise` functions.
4. Get to know what is it inside the `src/fp/setoid.ts` and `src/fp/ord.ts`, implement the `sort` inside of the `array.ts`.
5. When all preparations are done, and all tests inside the `test/fp` are passing (ensure it by `npm run test:fp` command), you can start implementing the code of the `src/main.ts`.
6. Fix the `getClients` function, because it returns the raw data of the client, where `demands` is just `Array<Demand> | null`. You need to transform it to the `Maybe<Array<Demand>>`.
7. Implement the code of the `show` function.

The details of the `show` function:

- The first line represents how many of the clients the executor can reach.
- If all of them: `This executor meets all demands of all clients!`.
- If some of them: `This executor meets the demands of only ${number} out of ${number} clients`.
- If none of them: `This executor cannot meet the demands of any client!`. This would be the only line, and the result itself would be `left`.

:::info
Remember that you should check if the executor meets the demands of the particular client only if the demands are _none_! If it is _none_ - the demands is met by default.
:::

The first line of the table should be:
`Available clients sorted by ` + `highest reward` in case if `SortBy.reward` was passed, or `distance to executor` in case of `SortBy.distance`.

## Tips

* Investigate every file in the `src` folder, especially `utils` files. There are useful functions which might come in handy.
* Check the usage examples of different functions and type classes in the tests.
* Use `fold`, `map` or `getOrElse` to get or manipulate the data inside the type class. Avoid using of the `either.right` or `maybe.value` (but of course, you should use it in order to implement functions like `map` and `fold`).
